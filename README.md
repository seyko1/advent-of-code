# About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles.

# Get started

I decide to try to solve the puzzles using Javascript and Node.js runtime.

## Project directories

I use the following nomenclature :

`<year>/<day>/<part-number>`

## Initialize a new node project

```console
npm init
```

## How to execute

```console
cd <year>/<day>
npm run part-<number>
```
